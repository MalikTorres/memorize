# Memorize Card App

## Overview
The Memorize Card App is a fun and interactive memory game developed using Swift and SwiftUI. Inspired by Stanford's Swift course, this app allows users to engage with a card-matching game where they flip cards to reveal symbols and try to find matching pairs.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Tap cards to flip them and reveal hidden symbols.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Smooth animations for card flipping.
- **Customizable Themes**: Incorporate different sets of symbols for variety.
- **Elegant UI**: Built with SwiftUI, ensuring a clean and responsive interface.

## Learning Objectives
This project is being built to:
- Gain hands-on experience with Swift and SwiftUI.
- Understand state management using `@State` and reactive programming principles.
- Explore the ZStack layout and modifiers for creating visually appealing interfaces.
- Learn about structuring Swift code for modularity and reusability.

## Code Example
```swift
struct CardView: View {
    @State var isFaceUp = false

    var body: some View {
        ZStack {
            let base = RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
            if isFaceUp {
                base.fill(Color.white)
                base.strokeBorder(lineWidth: 2)
                Text("ðŸ‘»").font(.largeTitle)
            } else {
                base.fill(Color.blue)
            }
        }
        .onTapGesture {
            isFaceUp.toggle()
        }
    }
}
```

## Development Environment
- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Tools**: Xcode

## Acknowledgments
This project is developed as part of the Stanford Swift course, which offers an in-depth exploration of iOS development and Swift programming principles. A special thanks to the instructors for providing clear guidance and hands-on projects to build real-world skills.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a scoring system to track player performance.
- Implement multi-round gameplay with increasing difficulty.
- Introduce sound effects and haptic feedback for a more engaging experience.
